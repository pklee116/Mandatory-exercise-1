## 

## 1. Opening

You should start by opening the Qmd-file in RStudio and read in different packages.

Push the green arrow in the chink or run it line by line (Ctrl+Enter)

```{r init}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readxl)
X <- "x"
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Remove messages

You can modify your code block easily.

-   You can remove all the messages in the top by writing `#| message=FALSE` in the code block. Try it out.

    You can hide the code block by writing \`, #\| echo=FALSE\` in the code block. Try it out.

-   You can exclude everything using \`include = FALSE\`

-   You can remove warnings using \`warning = FALSE\`

Try it out on this first. You can check the knittet output.

## 2. Variables - make your first code

Try to create a variable. Assign the number 4. Update the variable with a mathematical operator such that results ends being 8.

```{r}

# here, assign 4 to a variable. 

# here, use a math operator (*+-/) such that the results will be 8 
```

### Running code - and do your first debug

Be sure you have evaluated (run) the very first code chunk in this document called `init`.

If you want to run the code below as you are knitting, remove the chunk option `#|eval=FALSE` from the chunk below.

```{r}

#| eval=FALSE

# I wrote this code for you
x <- "R-code"

X

```

You can even include the content of `X` in your document text by using `` `r ` ``. around the code part to get the content of X: `` `r x` ``

But why does it not work? it should spit out "R-code"?

## 3. You should read in two files

The data for this exercise is in the file \`who_disease.csv\` in Canvas. You should download it to your own course folder before reading it into R. It is easiest, if you have it in the same folder as the r-code

-   Start by importing this data set using the RStudio data import widget. You can either do this via the **Import Dataset** button that you find in the Environment pane, or from the file menu.

Either way, this file is a CSV file (text).

-   Before importing the data, check if the columns-types are meaningful.

-   Copy the code before clicking on **Import**.

Once you have imported your data set, it appears in your Global Environment (the Environment pane)

as `who_disease`. If you click on the small table icon to the far right of the name of the data set,

you get a preview of the data.

-   Now paste the code that you copied before into the empty code chunk below for reading in the data. Delete the line `View(who_disease)` from the pasted code.

-   Do the same for `BagsOfOranges.xlsx`. Notice, that this is an excel-file!

```{r}

#| cache=TRUE

## This is an empty code chunk. Fill in the loading code here
who_disease <- read.csv("D:/OneDrive - The Chinese University of Hong Kong/CBS/programming/exercise 1/who_disease.csv")
BagsOfOranges <- read_excel("BagsOfOranges.xlsx")
```

### Insert code chunck and look at files

-   Try to insert a code chunk here and look at one of the files from Ex 2 using the command `head(dataframe_name)`.

-   You can also use `str()` and `summary()`. What do they show?

You will use the files in next class.

## 4. Customization of the document

In this exercise, you should modify the existing chunks and chunk options to customize the results.

-   Clean your Quarto document:

-   Check the organization of chunks and give them names.

-   Change the setting on code folding so that code is not shown by default.

### Tutorials and interactive resources

If you have more time, try out:

-   The `swirl` package. See also the script `Rtutorial_swirl.r`. Swirl is a tutorial build into the R-interface.

-   [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) has some nice tutorials your can try out. I am trying to get you a student license for the course.
