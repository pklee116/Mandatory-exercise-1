# Sine Zambach 2021
# Good tutorial to start with

#Install Swirl - only first time
install.packages("swirl")

# Load in
library(swirl)
swirl()


# When you are ready, write  swirl() in the consoll and get started:
# 
# | You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit
# | and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know you've done so.
# | When you are at the R prompt (>):
# | -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
# | -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
# | -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
# | -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
# | -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
# | -- Typing info() displays these options again.

## If you cannot get out and is stucked, you can start from scratch again by the following code:
remove.packages("swirl") # Removes package
install.packages("swirl") # Reinstall package

library(swirl)
swirl()
